This project is about a basic recipe website, the ingredients, description and steps of the following recipes and dishes are all from the Allrecipes website. The purpose of this project is to use my HTML skills that I have learned so far from the Odin Project Website. I have been having fun coding this project but i'm still quite slow hope this improves for more projects and practice.
